# Journal App

A simple **Journal App** that allows users to create an account and login to add images and write thoughts, storing all data using **Firebase**. The app is built with **Java** and follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architectural pattern to ensure clean and maintainable code.

## Features

- **Add Images**: Users can capture or select images from their device and add them to their journal entries.
- **Write Thoughts**: Users can add text to describe or reflect on the image.
- **Firebase Authentication**: Users must create an account to use the app. Authentication is handled using Firebase, ensuring secure login and registration.
- **Firebase Integration**: All journal entries, including images and thoughts, are stored in **Firebase** for cloud synchronization.
- **MVVM Architecture**: The app uses the **MVVM** design pattern to separate the UI from business logic, making the app scalable and easier to maintain.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Programming language used for Android development.
- **Android SDK**: Android development tools and libraries.
- **Firebase Authentication**: Used for user account creation and login, enabling secure user authentication.
- **Firebase Database**: For real-time storage and synchronization of journal entries, including images and thoughts.
- **Firebase Storage**: For storing and retrieving images uploaded by users.
- **MVVM Architecture**: Model-View-ViewModel design pattern for cleaner code structure and separation of concerns.
